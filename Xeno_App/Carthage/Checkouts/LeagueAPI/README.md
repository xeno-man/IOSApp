League API is a League of Legends Framework in Swift. It provides an easy way to get League's data into your iOS, WatchOS, TvOS and MacOS & Linux application.  

It is designed to be easy to use, taking advantage of Swift enums. It also comes with some internal mechanisms, to handle any API key rate limit. 

**Support League of Legends, Clash, Teamfight Tactics and League of Runnetera APIs**

## üöß Installation üöß

### CocoaPods

* Go in your project, in the folder where is located *YourProject.xcodeproj*.
* Run `pod init`.
* Open Podfile for editing (do not use Textedit as it will insert invalid characters).
* Right under "use_frameworks!", write `pod 'LeagueAPI'`.
* Run `pod install`.
* A *YourProject.xcworkspace* was created. From now, you should open this file instead of *YourProject.xcodeproj*.
* If you can write `import LeagueAPI` in your project without compiler error, you're done. Great job! If it is not the case, you can open an issue so that I can look at your problem.

### Carthage

* Go in your project, in the folder where is located *YourProject.xcodeproj*.
* Create a file named *Cartfile* and write `github "Kelmatou/LeagueAPI"` in it.
* Run `carthage bootstrap --platform iOS --use-xcframeworks` in Terminal (for Xcode < 12, you don't necessarily need to add --use-xcframeworks).
* Open *YourProject.xcodeproj* and go to target General settings.
* Add LeagueAPI.framework in Embedded Binaries (located at Carthage/Build/LeagueAPI.xcframework).
* If you can write `import LeagueAPI` in your project without compiler error, you're done. Great job! If it is not the case, read the troubleshooting section below.

### Manual
* Download a Release version [here](https://github.com/Kelmatou/LeagueAPI/releases) (or Github content but you may get a version with experimental changes).
* Open *LeagueAPI/LeagueAPI.xcodeproj*.
* Select LeagueAPI-Release scheme and build it (play button or cmd+b) for your desired platform (Simulator or iOS Generic Device).
* In the Project Navigator, you'll find a folder Products with *LeagueAPI.framework*. Drag and drop it in your project general settings -> Embedded Binaries.
* If you can write `import LeagueAPI` in your project without compiler error, you're done. Great job! If you encounter a problem on this step, check if you selected the same platform as LeagueAPI.framework in you project's destination target (Simulator or iOS device). If it does not solve your problem, read the troubleshooting section below.

### Troubleshooting

This section lists the main solutions to be able to `import LeagueAPI` in your project.

* Go back to your project, target settings -> Build Settings -> Framework Search Paths, then add the path to LeagueAPI.framework.

If none of these helped you, open an issue describing your problem and I'll try to check it out as soon as possible.


## üìã Requirements üìã

### üì¶ Minimum versions üì¶

üì± iOS 9.0  
‚åö WatchOS 2.0  
üì∫ TvOS 9.0

### üîë Riot API Key üîë

To use LeagueAPI, you'll require a Riot API Key.
You'll get one by visiting https://developer.riotgames.com. Create an account and on you dashboard, you'll be able to generate your key.
By default, Riot will generate a 'Development Key', which expires in 24h. When your application is ready to be deployed and respects Riot API usage conditions, you can apply for a 'Production Key'.
Please note that you should agree with [Riot API usage policy](https://developer.riotgames.com/policies.html)

## üòà First Blood üòà

Starting using this framework requires you to create an instance of LeagueAPI by writing:

`let league = LeagueAPI(APIToken: "*INSERT YOUR KEY HERE*")`
